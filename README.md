# Modeling-and-Inferring-Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction
Source for the selected dataset: Airline Passenger Satisfaction | Kaggle

The proposed dataset aims to explore the factors that impact airline passenger satisfaction and how these differ across various features available in the dataset. By analyzing a variety of features, such as flight distance, gate location, ease of online booking, and so on, we hope to gain insight into which factors impact the most in the satisfaction of the customer using Laplace approximation. Additionally, we plan to examine how satisfaction criteria may differ among various age groups, customer types (such as loyal customers or not), and types of travel (such as business or personal). By understanding these factors, airlines can make informed decisions on how to improve the customer experience and ultimately increase satisfaction levels.
